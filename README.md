# 🛡️ Security Portfolio - "Secure by Design"

A professional cybersecurity portfolio website that demonstrates security best practices through its own implementation. This project serves as both a showcase of cybersecurity expertise and a practical demonstration of secure web development practices.

## 🚨 Security-First Architecture

This portfolio is built with a **"Security by Design"** philosophy, where every component, endpoint, and interaction is hardened against common vulnerabilities:

- **🔒 Strict Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and more
- **🛡️ Input Validation**: Comprehensive Zod validation on all user inputs
- **⚡ Rate Limiting**: API endpoints protected against abuse with Upstash Redis
- **🔍 XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- **📊 Live Security Monitoring**: Real-time security posture analysis
- **🎯 Zero Trust Approach**: Every interaction is validated and secured

## 🏗️ Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Next.js 14+** with App Router - Modern React framework with Server Components
- **TypeScript** - Type safety for enhanced security
- **Tailwind CSS v3** - Utility-first styling with custom security theme
- **Prisma** - Type-safe database ORM with query parameterization
- **Zod** - Runtime type validation for all inputs

### Security Dependencies
- **@upstash/ratelimit** - Redis-based rate limiting
- **@upstash/redis** - Serverless Redis for security state
- **lucide-react** - Security-themed iconography
- **framer-motion** - Smooth animations with performance optimization

### Development Tools
- **ESLint** - Code quality and security linting
- **Autoprefixer** - CSS vendor prefixing
- **PostCSS** - CSS processing pipeline

## 🎨 Design Philosophy: "Guardian Silent"

The visual design embodies cybersecurity principles:
- **Dark Theme**: Terminal-inspired aesthetic
- **Cyan (#00ffff)** and **Green (#00ff88)** accents - Classic security/hacker colors
- **Monospace Typography** - Code-focused, technical appearance
- **Subtle Glows**: Terminal-like visual effects
- **High Contrast**: Accessibility and readability focused

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

### 1. **Security Headers** (`next.config.ts`)
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS by controlling resource loading
- **Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME sniffing attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking
- **Referrer Policy**: Controls referrer information leakage
- **Permissions Policy**: Limits browser API access

### 2. **Input Validation** (`lib/validations.ts`)
- Comprehensive Zod schemas for all user inputs
- Malicious pattern detection
- Type-safe data parsing and sanitization
- Custom validation rules for security contexts

### 3. **Component-Level Security**
- Props validation and sanitization
- Secure rendering practices
- No dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage
- Controlled component state management

     -d '{"name":"<script>alert(1)</script>","email":"test@example.com","subject":"test","message":"test"}'
   ```

3. **Rate Limiting Verification**
   ```bash
   # Test rate limiting (should trigger on 6th request)
