🚨 Just saw another SaaS startup lose a $2M deal over missing security headers.

Here's the thing - 73% of enterprise buyers require SOC2 compliance before signing.

But most startups treat security as an afterthought:
❌ "We'll add security later"  
❌ "We're too small to be a target"
❌ "Security slows down development"

The reality? Security-first companies close enterprise deals 3x faster.

Here's how APEX AI went from C- to A+ security in 90 days: [Thread] 🧵
