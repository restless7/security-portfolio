üö® Just saw another SaaS startup lose a $2M deal over missing security headers.

Here's the thing - 73% of enterprise buyers require SOC2 compliance before signing.

But most startups treat security as an afterthought:
‚ùå "We'll add security later"  
‚ùå "We're too small to be a target"
‚ùå "Security slows down development"

The reality? Security-first companies close enterprise deals 3x faster.

Here's how APEX AI went from C- to A+ security in 90 days: [Thread] üßµ
