# ✅ GitHub Actions Monorepo Configuration Fixed

## 🚨 Issue Resolved

**Error**: `Dependencies lock file is not found in /home/runner/work/security-portfolio/security-portfolio. Supported file patterns: package-lock.json,npm-shrinkwrap.json,yarn.lock`

**Root Cause**: GitHub Actions workflows were configured for a standalone repository but your security portfolio is in a monorepo structure (`planmaestro-ecosystem/packages/security-portfolio/`).

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Moved Workflows to Root Level**
```bash
# Workflows moved from:
packages/security-portfolio/.github/workflows/
# To:
.github/workflows/
```

### 2. **Fixed Node.js Setup for Monorepo**
```yaml
- name: 🔧 Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18'
    cache: 'npm'
    cache-dependency-path: 'packages/security-portfolio/package.json'  # Added this
```

### 3. **Updated All Commands with Correct Paths**
```yaml
- name: 📦 Install Dependencies
  run: |
    cd packages/security-portfolio  # Added this
    npm ci
```

### 4. **Added Path Filters for Efficiency**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
    paths:
      - 'packages/security-portfolio/**'        # Only run when security portfolio changes
      - '.github/workflows/security-ci.yml'    # Or when workflow itself changes
```

### 5. **Fixed All Build and Security Commands**
- All `npm` commands now run in `/packages/security-portfolio/`
- All file paths updated for monorepo structure
- ESLint config fixed to use `eslint.config.mjs`
- Build outputs checked in correct `.next` directory

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

Your GitHub Actions workflows will now:

1. ✅ **Find dependencies correctly** - No more lock file errors
2. ✅ **Run security tests** - Path-aware testing and linting
3. ✅ **Execute cron health checks** - Every 6 hours via GitHub Actions
4. ✅ **Only run when needed** - Path filters prevent unnecessary runs

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**: All workflows are configured
2. **Set up secrets**: Follow `CRON_SETUP.md` for `CRON_SECRET` configuration
3. **Test manual trigger**: Go to Actions tab → "🔐 Security Health Check (Every 6 Hours)" → Run workflow

## 🎯 Expected Results

After pushing to GitHub, you should see:
- No more "Dependencies lock file is not found" errors
- Successful workflow runs in Actions tab
- Automated security health checks every 6 hours
- Vercel deployments working without cron limitations

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Ready for GitHub deployment
